## This repo will consist links and resources related to CPython:
* Aimed to be the open place for CPython things.
* Will add blog posts, books or maybe some interesting notes related CPython.
* Especially interested in adding more video links from conferences which I have found with my own notes.
* Please if you see something new then send PR with new related information.
* Expected to be huge README file.
* I want to speak in English, Russian and Turkish. Please do not be surprised.
